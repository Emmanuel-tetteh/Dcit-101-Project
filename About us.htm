My name is Emmanel Agormeda Tetteh
 believe I am a person who dreams big and has big ambitions in life. Doctors have always been my inspiration since my father himself is one. I have seen him sacrifice his vacation time and free time with families in order to save lives at hospitals. When I was small, I used to get angry when my dad left and went away by terming it is an emergency. I never understood why he did that when I was a small kid. But now that I understand what he does is more important than playing games with me, I always wish him good luck when he goes to work. I know he saves a lot of lives each and every day and that is the reason everyone is my apartment and at my school respect him.

When I grow up, I want to become like my father and save people’s lives. I believe I am a person with empathy. I usually don’t get angry and I always try to understand why people behave the way they do. I always stand in their shoe and look at things from their point of view. This has helped me understand the world better and I believe that has made me a better human being. My father always says that to become a good human being, and more importantly a good doctor, one needs to have empathy and have lots of patience. I strongly believe that I have both those qualities.

I am a strong believer in God and the existence of supernatural power in our universe. I hail from an orthodox brahmin family and these religious and spiritual values have been inculcated in my nature right from my childhood. These values have always helped me grow as a better person. The belief that there is a God watching whatever we do from up above the sky makes me be careful before committing mistakes knowingly. The fear of God has made me a righteous person from the beginning.

I am an ambivert, which means I enjoy socialising with people once in a while and at the same time I also enjoy being alone, at the comfort of my own company. This nature of mine has helped me in my studies as well as free time. In case I find a subject to be difficult, I and my friends do group study and have fun while doing so. At times, when I prefer to be alone, I try to learn some new habit like reading a book or learning a guitar.

I am a kind person by heart and I intentionally never try to hurt people., as I said at the beginning of this “who am I essay”, I am an empathetic person with no ego and attitude problems. I can gel well with people and my friends like me. But, like every human being, I too have some bad qualities. I usually get angry at my mother whenever she makes potato because I don’t like potato and sometimes waste the food that she has cooked for me. I bite my nails which is an unhealthy habit. I am a person who works hard and is trying to improve myself.
